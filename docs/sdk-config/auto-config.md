- **`linear_min_v`**: Sets minimum linear velocity for autonomy. 
- **`linear_max_v`**: Sets maximum linear velocity for autonomy.
- **`angular_max_w`**: Sets maximum angular velocity for autonomy.
- **`linear_max_a`**: Sets maximum linear acceleration for autonomy.

---
- **`obstacle_cost_gains`**: Sets weight for an obstacle course based on the weighted sum of the map.
- **`speed_cost_gains`**: Sets weight for speed cost.
- **`goal_cost_gains`**:  Sets weight for goal cost.

- **`costmap_scale`**: Sets scale to convert map from meter to pixels.
---
!!! note "Note that the point cloud height is measured from the center of the lidar. If the ground is detected, it will be considered as an obstacle. Therefore, set the minimum value to be above the ground."

- **`max_pc_height`**: Sets maximum point cloud height to be considered as an obstacle.
- **`min_pc_height`**: Sets minimum point cloud height to be considered as an obstacle.
---
!!! tip "Do not remove too much from the point cloud filter as obstacles around the robot might not be considered."

<p>&nbsp;</p>



#### 2.2.4 Planner

- **`lookAheadIndexv`**: Sets look-ahead index from the nearest waypoint for path to follow. Note that a lower index slows down the movement of the robot. Similarly, a higher index results in the robot not follow path properly.
- **`enable_self_rotate`**: Enables one round of rotation around the robot itself before performing autonomy. This is to ensure that localisation is working before starting autonomy.
- **`self_rotation_speed`**: Sets angular velocity of robot to turn around itself before performing autonomy (in radiants/second).
